# LCARS UI

[LCARS (Library Computer Access/Retrieval System)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LCARS) is the iconic science-fiction UI designed by Mike Okuda for Star Trek: The Next Generation and used in all Star Trek productions that take place in the late 24th century. 

Many recreations of LCARS exist as static graphics or as Flash animations. This project shows that one can develop a responsive LCARS interface entirely with modern web technologies. The interface responds to fit any screen and collapses to a minimal form for mobile devices. Even works on [PADDs](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Personal_Access_Display_Device) (ahem, tablets)!
